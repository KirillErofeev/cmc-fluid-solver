08.10.2011
	Committed MPI version of cmc-fluid-solver with multi GPU support
24.08.2011
	Added pinned mpi_buf to AdiSolver
25.08.2011 - 26.08.2011
	Moved Segment3D, MAX_SEGS_PER_ROW to Grid3D.h
	Moved a part of CreateListSegments into Grid3D as GenerateListSegments
	Implemented PARAplan and GPUplan initialization from arbitrary splitting
	Added segment analysis Grid3D::SplitSegments_X for work load optimization on Multi GPU
	Fixed a bug, introduced into CPU version
	All MPI communications in LaunchSolveSegments_X_var and syncHalos() are done through pinned memory, mpi_buf
09.09.2011
	Added splitting by equal volumes (EVEN_VOLUME) for workload optimization
	Fixed a bug in MPI version
	INTERNAL_MERGE_ENABLE = 1 in AdiSolver.h will switch on Nonlinear Layer Merging on segment's update
	Added ifdebug flag for printing stats in AdiSolver, set by debug(ifdebug)
14.09.2011
	Cleaned the solution from redundant and commented code. Removed routines used for debugging.
07.10.2011
	Considerably reduced amount of GPU memory required. Grid and its transposed version are not stored in GPU anymore.
	Grid Boundaries are used instead and located in NodesBoundary3D *array. At the moment, grid and transposed grid node types 
	are still stored in the GPU memory. Layer 'half' is not required when transpose optimization is ON.
	Also put back few routines for debugging into AdiSolver3D.
