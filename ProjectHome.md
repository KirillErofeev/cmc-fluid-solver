We're working on a program product for simulation of incompressible viscid fluid in 2D/3D domains with dynamic boundaries. We use full system of Navier-Stokes equations that includes continuity, impulse and energy equations. For numerical methods we use finite difference methods on regular grids. The plans are to support some explicit and half-implicit (based on ADI scheme) finite diffrence methods.

The GPU acceleration will be used to speed-up the solver in large 2D/3D domains. Targeting on NVIDIA hardware, CUDA platform.

Target applications are aerodynamic flows, blood simulation in heart and vessels and underwater flows simulation in seas.

More information later.
